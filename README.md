Design and implement a white-box test for a program that computes the sine and cosine functions in a specialized manner. This program is going to be part of an embedded system running on a processor that does not support floating-point arithmetic. The program to be tested is attached. Your job is to test the functions sin and cos; you are to assume that the functions sin0to45 and sin45to90 have already been tested.
